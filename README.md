# GoToHere.com

This is the source code for the GoToHere.com social network. 
It runs locally on your device. It uses the KnotFree.net network to pass messages.

It's completely distributed and there is no central authority. There's nobody to give your email to. No 'signup'. You simply install it and you run it. 

The code here can also be used to serve ANY webpage from your device (ie. laptop) with a url like: your-page-name.gotohere.com See http://alice_vociferous_mcgrath.gotohere.com/ for an example.


## Installation

Install nodejs. For me it's:
    `brew install node`
There are instructions for most platforms.

Clone this repo. cd to the new directory.
    `yarn install` 

See the documentation for [more instructions.](https://github.com/awootton/GoToHere/wiki)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

This will start both the server and the react dev server.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
